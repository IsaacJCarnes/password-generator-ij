Pressing the 'Generate Password' button prompts for password configuration settings and then provides the user a randomly generated password from the preferences they selected.
This is useful for creating passwords for accounts, you want your password to be secure and some websites require diffetrent types of characters, this website makes that process simple and fast.

To use the website first press the 'generate password' button. Then fill out the prompts as they come up, the length must be between 8 and 125, there must be at least one set of characters added. However if either of these requirements are not met the website will alter the password to keep it within basic requirements.

Here is a screenshot of the website
